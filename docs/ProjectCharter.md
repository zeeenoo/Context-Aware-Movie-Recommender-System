# Project Charter: Context-Aware Movie Recommender System

## Problem Statement
Develop a context-aware recommender system that provides personalized Product recommendations based on user preferences.

## Goals
1. Improve recommendation accuracy by incorporating contextual information
2. Increase user engagement and satisfaction with movie recommendations
3. Develop a scalable and deployable solution

## Scope
- Use the Amazon Reviews 2023 dataset  for training and evaluation
- Implement a Context-Aware Matrix Factorization (CAMF) model
- Develop a user-friendly interface for interacting with the recommender system
- Deploy the solution using Docker for easy distribution and scaling

## Success Criteria
1. Achieve a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of less than 0.9 on the test set
2. Demonstrate improved recommendation relevance compared to a non-context-aware baseline
3. Successfully deploy the system and make it accessible via a web interface

## Stakeholders
- Data Science Team: Responsible for model development and evaluation (me)
- DevOps Team: Handle deployment and infrastructure (me)
- Product Manager: Oversee project progress and align with business goals (me)
- End Users: Movie enthusiasts who will use the recommender system (me & Freinds)

## Timeline
- Day 1-2: Data ingestion and exploration
- Day 3-4: Model development and training
- Day 5: Model evaluation and refinement
- Day 6: UI development and integration
- Day 7: Deployment and testing
- Day 8: Final adjustments and project wrap-up

## Risks and Mitigation
1. Data quality issues: Implement robust data cleaning and validation processes
2. Model performance: Continuously monitor and refine the model, consider ensemble methods if necessary
3. Scalability concerns: Design with scalability in mind, use efficient algorithms and optimize resource usage
4. Privacy considerations: Ensure compliance with data protection regulations and implement appropriate security measures
