# Deployment Instructions

## Prerequisites
- Docker installed on the deployment machine
- Access to the project repository

## Steps to Deploy

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/context-aware-recommender.git
   cd context-aware-recommender
   ```

2. Build the Docker image:
   ```
   docker build -t movie-recommender .
   ```

3. Run the Docker container:
   ```
   docker run -d -p 8501:8501 --name movie-recommender-app movie-recommender
   ```

4. Access the application:
   Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- View container logs:
  ```
  docker logs movie-recommender-app
  ```

- Stop the container:
  ```
  docker stop movie-recommender-app
  ```

- Remove the container:
  ```
  docker rm movie-recommender-app
  ```

- Update the application:
  1. Pull the latest code from the repository
  2. Rebuild the Docker image
  3. Stop and remove the old container
  4. Run a new container with the updated image

## Troubleshooting

- If the application is not accessible, check if the container is running:
  ```
  docker ps
  ```

- If there are issues with the container, try rebuilding the image and running a new container

- For persistent issues, check the application logs and the Streamlit output in the container logs

## Scaling

To handle increased load, consider the following options:
1. Deploy multiple containers behind a load balancer
2. Use Docker Swarm or Kubernetes for orchestration and automatic scaling
3. Optimize the model and application code for better performance

## Backup and Recovery

- Regularly backup the trained model and any persistent data
- Document the steps to restore the system from backups
- Test the recovery process periodically to ensure it works as expected
